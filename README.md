# E-Radar

## What does it do?
E-Radar is .Net Core console application which searches an IMAP mailbox for new emails with a subject or body containing certain keywords
and sends an SMS notification if emails that matching emails are found. 

## Why does it matter?
Have you ever gotten an email that you really needed to know about **right now** only to see it when it was too late? With this app, you don't
have to worry about being the last person to see that important memo or notification about a business lead. 
Many email clients, especially on mobile devices (looking at you Apple Mail), will only check for new messages at preset intervals.
It doesn't do much good to check for new emails every 15 minutes when a message that requires your immediate attention could come in at any time. 

## How does it work? 
You can configure E-Radar to search your IMAP mailbox for new emails that match a list of preset keywords at a given time interval, as frequently as every minute, and have it send you an SMS notification if emails that match the search criteria are located.
